# backmask_app

* In progress

This app will host a blog where initially I will be able to upload audio files, reverse them, and write about them. Later, other users will be able to create accounts and post their own reversed audio files and offer commentary.

From Wikipedia:
> Backmasking is a recording technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional.
